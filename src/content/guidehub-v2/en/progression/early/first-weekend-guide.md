## Overview {#overview}

## Preparation before launch														
- Pre-register your account early to start collecting Twitch drops.														
- Collect drops a few weeks before the server opens, but only grab the ones that expire soon (7 days after the Dropy Cycle ends). Save rewards like stone/wood packages until your fortress is built up. Remember that you can stack multiple Drop Campaigns without collecting them first. Hold onto potion drops until you hit level 32 to get the big potion.Resources from Twitch Drops generate as soon as you hit "claim" on Twitch.														
														
														
- Pre-purchase the Starter Pack to avoid transaction issues at server launch.														
- On day 1 and 2, your main limitation is the 300 thirst, so use it wisely.														
- Heavy shroomer level goals: You can aim for level 69 on day 1, level 90-125 on day 2 (depending on your class), and try for level 200-210 on day 3, especially if you unlock the underworld.														
______________________________
## Day 1

### Level 1-3																
- When the server launches, join any random guild, sell your Starter Pack potion for 100 gold, and upgrade guild skills to 6 instructor and 4 treasure																
- Wait for the invite to your main guild while doing 8 Arena fights to reach level 2																
- Unlock the Training Dungeon and fight the first enemies to reach level 3. If the dungeon is buggy, fighting the first enemy multiple times can get you to level 4. (immediatly close your Game, after clearing enemies in the Training Dungeon, for a higher chance that it bugs out and resets you back to enemy 1)																
																
																
### Level 4-10																
- Once your guild is full and everyone has upgraded their skills to 6/4, start doing short expeditions. Stick to short ones on day 1.																
- Keep doing expeditions until you reach level 10, which automatically unlocks the Scrapbook.																
- Log into SF on your phone or simultaniously on SFTools to get the "Second Screen" achievement for a free +5 to all stats.																
- Buy equipment from the Weapon and Magic shops, and small potions if needed. Ignore the talisman slot until level 15+.																
- Start farming the Hall of Fame (HoF) for stickers and a tiny bit of gold to fill your Scrapbook to 20-25% (30%+ for shroomers).																
- Spend gold quickly to avoid losing it in attacks from others.																
																
### Level 10-13																
- Farm players who give max gold within your 100 rank range, especially if you're a shroomer, for easy gold and stats.									(Still somewhat applies with the new Rumbe for Riches event, it is just nerfed and way more tedious and less effective)							
- Clear the Tutorial Dungeon and the light world Dungeon 1 for more gold and level-ups.																
- This should bring you to level 11-13, giving you more gold per enemy defeated while you are farming for Scrapbook % anyways.																
- Don't forget to get the "Rip-off Rip-off" achievement by winning 3 times in a row at the shell game, using the command "/gold bet 1" to bet the least gold.																
																
### Level 13-20																
- Once you can’t beat any more dungeon enemies, and your Scrapbook is at 25%+, start using thirst for expeditions until you hit level 15.																
- At level 15, talismans and medium potions become available in the Magic Shop.																
- Reequip yourself with new gear, prioritizing your weapon. Check your chances in SF Tools after each pruchase.																
- Aim for 35%+ Scrapbook as you approach level 20. Continue collecting stickers from the Hall of Fame.																
																
### Level 20-25																
- At level 20, you unlock the second dungeon, Mines of Gloria.																
- Reequip as you get stuck, prioritizing your weapon. You should be around level 22-23 now.																
- If you can't reach level 25 through dungeons, use any leftover thirst to level up.																

### Level 25+
- After unlocking the fortress, buy the Fortress Package and upgrade according to the guide here:
[[embed:fortress-link-buttons]]
- Be sure to leave your Gem Mine on Level 1 and Wall on Level 0 unless specifically otherwise instructed!
- Farm some Scrapbook percentage and use gold to upgrade your guild skills.																
- If you're stopping here for day 1, finish your arena fights and spin the Wheel of Fortune. If you're pushing further, save the spins for later.																
																
### Congratulations!																
If you're playing casually, this is a good spot to end day 1. If you want to keep pushing, follow the day 2 guide.																
______________________________																
## Day 2

### Level 25-50																
- On day 1, before mining for gems, wait until 22:30-23:00 to let your guild upgrade their Hall of Knights. Then spin the Wheel of Fortune 20 times and use the gold to mine gems.																
- Reequip yourself with items that have gem slots and add class-appropriate gems (aim for 5 main-stat gems and 4 constitution gems, or up to 8 main-stat gems if needed), use SF Tools to check what gear is effective for each enemy.																
- Clear dungeons until level 30, then get the next dungeon key for Ruins of Gnark from expeditions.																
- At level 32, you can theoretically find big potions, but waiting until level 35 gives you much better odds.																
- If you're stuck before level 40, use thirst to level up and unlock the Cutthroat Grotto dungeon key from expeditions.																
- Keep reequipping and clearing dungeons until you hit level 50.																
																
### Level 50-75																
- At level 50, you unlock the Epic Event in the Weapon & Magic shops, and the Emerald Scale Altar dungeon key in expeditions.																
- Reequip your gear and use SF Tools to check dungeon chances after each new piece of equipment.																
- Continue filling your Scrapbook with stickers from the Hall of Fame.																
- At level 66, unlock the Witch and start throwing in unwanted gear to get scrolls.																
- Use thirst if you're stuck at Emerald Scale Altar to hit level 70 and unlock the Toxic Tree dungeon key in the Magic shop.																
- Clear dungeons until level 75, which unlocks the Pet nest in expeditions. If possible, wait until level 80 before searching for the Pet nest and the next dungeon key in one go.																
- Hold off on pet habitat fights if you can until level 92-94 to maximize experience. Pet habitat fights scale with your level, so saving them until later gives more experience.																
- Upgrade your guild skills to 10/10 and keep improving your Hall of Knight to enhance guild and personal gems.																
																
### Level 75 is a good place to stop on day 2, since you unlock pets. Use any remaining thirst to collect missing pets. If you want to push further, continue with day 3.

## Day 3

### Level 75-90															
- Keep clearing dungeons and reequipping when stuck. Get the Magma Stream dungeon key from expeditions at level 80.															
- At level 90, you unlock the Smithy, making it easier to add gem slots to epic gear.															
															
### Level 90-105															
- If you get stuck before level 95, use your pet habitat fights to gain a few levels. Fill the rest of the gap using thirst, you can now find the dungeon key for Frost Blood Temple in expeditions.															
- At level 99, unlock the Demon Portal. Attack it at the end of the day after you've finished everything else.															
- Once you reach level 100, get the Toilet key and throw unnecessary epics into it to boost your aura.															
- At level 105, you unlock the Arena Manager. Upgrade the first attraction with speed and gold boosts, focus on 7-day skips after to unlock runes for %HP on your gear.															
															
### Level 105-130															
- If you're stuck on Killing Machine in Frost Blood Temple, upgrade your Gem Mine to level 5 for stronger gems. This helps especially for weaker PvE classes like Warrior and Battle Mage.															
- At level 110, unlock the final dungeon key, Pyramid of Madness, from the Weapon shop.															
- Level 125 unlocks the Tower and companions. Equip your companions with old or unused gear, but ignore the Tower for now as it will be too difficult.															
- At level 125, mine the Heart of the Underworld in your Gem Mine (Level 10) to access the Underworld. This is difficult to get on Day 3 but possible with luck in the Dice Game or a Fortress Package from SF streams.															
- Spend your Pro Package acoording to the guide here:
[[embed:underworld-pro-pack-link-button]]
- You also unlock Wheel of Fortune 2.0 in expeditions.															
- At level 130, unlock the Twister, a great source of experience, items, and gold. If you're stuck in normal dungeons, clear Twister floors to gain levels and reequip yourself.															
															
### Level 130-200+															
- Focus on clearing your dungeons, Twister floors, and reequipping whenever you get stuck.															
- At level 140, you unlock the Shadow World, which provides many epic items. Use these to gear up your companions and make them more effective. Also, check shops for any missing epic gear for them.															
- Once your companions are equipped, you can make progress in the Tower for extra gold from expeditions and clear more of the Shadow World.															
- Tip: If you're a Strength or Intelligence class, equipping a Dexterity potion instead of your main stat potion can sometimes help, especially with Kunigunde in the Shadow World and Tower. Use SF Tools to verify!															
															
### Tips for day 3															
- After 48 hours has passed from unlocking your Fortress on day 1, you can start gaining resources from fights if your opponent has also passed the 48-hour mark. Take advantage of this to farm resources for unlocking the Underworld if you haven’t done so yet.															
- This process is faster if you coordinate with a fortress buddy to time your 48-hour timers together.															
															
### End of the first weekend															
- If you’ve reached level 105 and unlocked the Arena Manager, that’s a big milestone! Anything beyond level 105 is a bonus and won't give a major advantage after a few months in the game.															
- Stay active and participate in all guild raids and fights for the accumulated XP, which adds up over time.
