## Overview {#overview}\r
\r
## Step 1\r
\r
You will need at least 1 Fortress Attack from your buddy saved in your inbox where you can counterattack.\r
\r

\r
## Step 2\r
\r
Open up the counterattack window and close it again.\r
\r
[[asset:step2adg]]\r
\r
## Step 3 \r
\r
Go to your Fortress and press attack, you will see your buddy on screen.\r
\r
[[asset:step3adg]]\r
\r
## Step 4\r
\r
Close this window again and don't do any attacks in Fortress for around 2 hours.\r
\r
## Step 5\r
\r
After around 2 hours, you will do your Fortress attack first, afterwards you can still do your counterattack from your mail inbox.\r
\r
## Note \r
\r
SF does not remember after the 2 hours have passed that the attack in Fortress is linked to the counterattack in the mail,												\r
thus you can easily duplicate the attack. If your buddy does the same, you can get 2 extra attacks each cycle.												\r
