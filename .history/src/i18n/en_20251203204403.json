Other servers (for example fusion servers) are scanned by other community projects and may have longer gaps between scans.\n\nThis means there can be several weeks or even months between two scans. You can always see the exact data age from the \"Last scan: …\" hint in top lists and profiles.\n\nIf you want your own profile to be more up to date, you can link your SFDataHub account and upload your own scans.
